# Huffman Code and LZ-78 Code

We are trying to realize the huffman code and lz-78 now. Please notice that
our work is not done yet.

This repository is also for my homework. The code maybe not strictly correct.

We have complete huffman code and lz78 code, and we realize a CLI for you!

## Installation
If you wanna try my code, you can open terminal and :
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/fremakvi/huff_and_lz78.git
```
For example, you want to encode a file with huffman, then:
Then open terminal and :
``` shell
python main.py -eh filename [-o output_name]
```
More information in help. You can run
``` shell
    python main.py -h
```
to get that. 

the filename.dec's sha256 should be the same as filename's.

As a fresh developer, this is my first time to write document. If I did something wrong/amateur, just submit issues or tell me directly.
