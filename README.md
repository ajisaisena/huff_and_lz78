# Huffman Code and LZ-78 Code

We are trying to realize the huffman code and lz-78 now. Please notice that
our work is not done yet.

This repository is also for my homework. The code maybe not strictly correct.

We have get Huffman Done!

## Installation
If you wanna try my code, you can open terminal and :
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/fremakvi/huff_and_lz78.git
```
Then Change file name in the `main()` in huffman.py.

the filename.dec's sha256 should be the same as filename's.

We will later develop the program as a CLI program. Wait me!
